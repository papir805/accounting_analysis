    "The distribution looks right-skewed, so the median will be a better choice to impute.  This makes sense for all the values, except for the one below.  It's reasonable to assume that if one has exited from public accounting, their `'Years Experience'` would be higher than their `'Years Public Before Exit'`.  If we impute the Median Years Before Exit of 3, this will be greater than their `'Years Experience`' of 1.  I'm unsure of how to handle this, but I my plan is to make their `'Years Public Before Exit'` equal the '`Years Experience'` value.  Since it's only one data value and the sample size is large, it shouldn't affect the overall sample too much."
