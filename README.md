# **US Accounting Analysis** - An analysis on data from a Reddit r/accounting survey

## Goal - To understand the typical accountant and the accounting field:
Because my wife was preparing to enter into the field of accounting and I was looking to develop projects to demonstrate proficiency with data analysis, I combined the two ideas together to create this project.  Additionally, she had done her own research on the field, stating that accountants with their CPA license earn more, as do accountants who start at a public accounting firm, then transition into working as an accountant in industry at a private company.  I used this data to better understand if those statements are true, as well as what a typical accountant looks like.

## How to use this repository:
Using Python, I broke the process down into three Jupyter notebooks.  Click each of the links below to see that part of the project:
